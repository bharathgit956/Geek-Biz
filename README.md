A student and tutor pairing app

The project objective is to build an android application to facilitate students to find tutors as per their requirements. Tutoring can be done either online or in-person.

The pairing considers a tutorâ€™s expertise in a particular subject based on the need of the student in that particular subject and pairs them depending on each other's availability and geographical location.
